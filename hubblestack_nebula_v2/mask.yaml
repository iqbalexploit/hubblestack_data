# This file is just a sample to demonstrate the functionalities of masking feature
# You should properly test you mask.yaml file before using it on production.
# Using wrong regular expressions can cost performance issues.

# This file is used by hubble's nebula module to selectively prevent some information
# ( like passwords ) from getting logged.

# query_name can be an actual 'query_name' or a '*'
# column can not be '*'. It needs to a an actual column name


# passwords are masked by this field
# it is optional
# it's default value is written in code
