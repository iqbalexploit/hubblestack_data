#
# The following checks aim to detect if a relevant mitigation technique against
# Meltdown or Spectre vulnerabilities is active.
# This is done in two separate checks: first checks if a needed kernel feature
# is present, the second checks if the feature reports as active or at
# least is not disabled. If both checks succeed, a host should be protected against
# the vulnerability in question.
# The reasoning for this approach was two fold:
# * in some Linux distros there was no other way to detect.
# * in large fleets of different Linux flavors tracking many different types of
# check results can become burdensome.
